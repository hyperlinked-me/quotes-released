When alternatives are on a par, the reasons that determine whether we are
making a mistake, are silent as to what to do. It is here, in the space of hard
choices, that we get to exercise our normative power: the power to create
reasons. When we choose, we can put ourselves behind an option. We become the
authors of our own lives. Instead of looking for reasons out there, we should
be looking for reasons in here: Who am I to be? People who do not exercise
their normative powers allow the world to write the story of their lives. They
let mechanisms of reward and punishment determine what they do.
