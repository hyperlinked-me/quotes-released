I like to think of cooking as an act of love. To prepare good food is to give
health and happiness to those you love, and yourself. The kitchen is where we
start and end our day. The craft of cooking connects the hands, the head, and
the heart. Make yourself important enough to cook for--even if you are alone.
Starting to cook always means for me, putting on my apron, because it makes you
feel different: you instantly feel like a chef. My apron is my uniform of love.
Preparation is meditation--and the smell is just lovely. I always do it at
nighttime, when everything is quiet.
