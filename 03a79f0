The more totally one takes in the world as a problem, the more inferior one is
going to feel inside oneself. It is obvious to us that the only way to work on
perfection is in the form of an objective work that is fully under your control
and is perfectible in some real ways. Either you eat up yourself and others
around you, trying for perfection; or you objectify that imperfection in a
work, on which you then unleash your creative powers. In this sense, some kind
of objective creativity is the only answer man has to the problem of life. In
this way he satisfies nature, as a vital animal plunging into the world; but he
also satisfies his own distinctive human nature because he plunges in on his
own symbolic terms. He takes in the world, makes a total problem out of it, and
then gives out a fashioned, human answer to that problem. This is the highest
that man can achieve.
