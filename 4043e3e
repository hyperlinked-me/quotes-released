Man needs a "second" world, a world of humanly created meaning, a new reality
that he can live, dramatize, nourish himself in. "Illusion" means creative play
at its highest level. Cultural illusion is a necessary ideology of
self-justification, a heroic dimension that is life itself to the symbolic
animal.

-- Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death
