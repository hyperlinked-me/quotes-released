It is possible to see a connection between the idea of heroism in "The Denial
of Death" and the concept of wabi-sabi in that both deal with the acceptance of
impermanence and the transience of life. Becker's argument is that heroism is a
way for individuals to cope with the fear of death and to find meaning in their
lives, while wabi-sabi is a way of finding beauty in the impermanence of life.
In this sense, one could argue that the acceptance of one's own mortality and
the transience of life is a form of heroism in itself, and that wabi-sabi can
be seen as a form of heroic acceptance of the imperfection and incompleteness
of life.
