The individual has to protect himself by narrowing down the world, shutting off
experience, developing an obliviousness both to the terrors of the world and to
his own anxieties. Otherwise he would be crippled for action. The well-adjusted
man has just this capacity to partialize the world for comfortable action. The
"normal" man bites off what he can chew and digest of life, and no more. As
soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffing at eternal
problems like life and death, then he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves
this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just
as their society maps these problems out for them.

-- Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death
