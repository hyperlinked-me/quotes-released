Playing around is very important for home cooking: it is not about perfection;
it is about discovering your own taste. Instead of getting confused and
worrying, feel free to choose whatever you like, and enjoy! This is the most
important thing. If you pick the things you love, and cook [them] yourself,
[they would not] harm you. Good food has become the centre of my life, because
it is the crossover of health and happiness--the two most important things in
life.
