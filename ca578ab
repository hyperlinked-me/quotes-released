We suspect that when our fires begin to burn low, we shall want the healing
peace of uncrowded mountains and spacious fields. After every idea has had its
day with us, and we have fought for it not wisely or too well, we in our turn
shall tire of the battle, and pass on to the young our thinning fascicle of
ideals. Then we shall take to the woods; we shall make friends of the animals;
we shall leave the world to stew in its own deviltry, and shall take no further
thought of its reform.

-- Will Durant, Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization, Volume 1
