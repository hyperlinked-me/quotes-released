The defeat of despair is not mainly an intellectual problem for an active
organism, but a problem of self-stimulation via movement. Beyond a given point
man is not helped by more "knowing," but only by living and doing in a partly
self-forgetful way. As Goethe put it, we must plunge into experience and then
reflect on the meaning of it. All reflection and no plunging drives us mad;
all plunging and no reflection, and we are brutes.

-- Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death
